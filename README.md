## Open and Pin my Tabs
This Google Chrome extension is an "extended" version of the "On startup" pages. Instead of using the built-in solution, this extension both opens AND pins all the URLs specified in the list. As it isn't possible to read the list of startup pages from the Chrome Settings directly, we have to have our own list of URLs.

## Motivation
In my work I use a bunch of specific pages all the time and have of course added them to my "Startup Pages". But all these pages have to be manually pinned, which is a pain in the *ss. 
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Features
- Open a specific set of URLs as tabs and pin each tab.
- If one of the URLs is already opened, skip it.
- You can choose not to open the `chrome://newtab/` page.
